									<p style="color:black">ADIYON GROUP ENGINEERING SOLUTION (AGES) is a specialized Design Office in Business Assistance, Training and Business Facilitation.</p>
									
									<div id="checkout">
										<p style="color:black"> AGES assistance increases revenues, income and jobs by promoting
autonomy and market solutions to poverty reduction
In the next five years AGES will become one of the best technical partners of
African governments, their financial partners, and the private sector in research and
the application of innovative solutions to boost economic development
<br><br>
The main concern of ADIYON GROUP ENGINEERING SOLUTION (AGES) is
to support the efforts of private entrepreneurs to meet the needs of the Beninese populations
in particular and African ones in general and to provide useful services in the resolution
problems they face. Many African companies are launching
in the production and processing of agricultural products as well as the realization of
industrial products with the aim of limiting imports. Indeed, the demand for currencies
to compensate for imported products is enormous; this is why the Beninese State has implemented
places the policy of promoting small and medium-sized businesses in order to supplement the strong
import rate of essential products. This situation has led to a creative boom
of companies without prior preparation. The conclusion is the high mortality rate
emerging businesses.
To remedy this catastrophic situation, the AGES Company was created, on the one hand, to
provide substantial support to business leaders in order to support them within the framework of the
sustainability of young companies whose contribution to GDP is a factor to be taken into account
important in the development of the country. On the other hand, to contribute to offering
opportunities for rural African populations to participate in development
socio-economic and environmental of their country.
The strengths of AGES in solving business problems are:<br>
 <h5>Ability to provide young businesses with tools such as: a plan
strategic plan, a business plan, a marketing plan, a monitoring-evaluation mechanism
activities and training;</h5><br>

<h5>  Ability to mobilize donors for the financing of high-risk projects
added value;</h5><br>

<h5>  Availability of a network on the international market in general and the American market in
particularly to support the growth of Beninese trade.
The weaknesses that could be observed relate to the lack of culture in the African context.
the call to consulting firms to monitor company activities.
However, there are possibilities to support businesses to the extent that
individual skills exist but are not structured and do not have the tools
efficient.The threats are:</h5>
<br>
<h5>The eventual proliferation of non-competent organizations whose objective will be to
claim to support existing or emerging businesses.</h5>  <br>
<h5>Political instability which could limit access to state tenders.</h5>
